## Model information

This section describes the MedGemma model and how to use it.

### Description

MedGemma is a collection of [Gemma 3](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core)
variants that are trained for performance on medical text and image
comprehension. Developers can use MedGemma to accelerate building
healthcare-based AI applications. MedGemma currently comes in two variants: a 4B
multimodal version and a 27B text-only version.

MedGemma 4B utilizes a [SigLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15343) image encoder
that has been specifically pre-trained on a variety of de-identified medical
data, including chest X-rays, dermatology images, ophthalmology images, and
histopathology slides. Its LLM component is trained on a diverse set of medical
data, including radiology images, histopathology patches, ophthalmology images,
and dermatology images.

MedGemma 4B is available in both pre-trained (suffix: `-pt`) and
instruction-tuned (suffix `-it`) versions. The instruction-tuned version is a
better starting point for most applications. The pre-trained version is
available for those who want to experiment more deeply with the models.

MedGemma 27B has been trained exclusively on medical text and optimized for
inference-time computation. MedGemma 27B is only available as an
instruction-tuned model.

MedGemma variants have been evaluated on a range of clinically relevant
benchmarks to illustrate their baseline performance. These include both open
benchmark datasets and curated datasets. Developers can fine-tune MedGemma
variants for improved performance. Consult the Intended Use section below for
more details.

A full technical report will be available soon.

### How to use

Below are some example code snippets to help you quickly get started running the
model locally on GPU. If you want to use the model at scale, we recommend that
you create a production version using [Model
Garden](https://cloud.google.com/model-garden).

First, install the Transformers library. Gemma 3 is supported starting from
transformers 4.50.0.

```sh
$ pip install -U transformers
```

**Run model with the `pipeline` API**

```python
from transformers import pipeline
from PIL import Image
import requests
import torch

pipe = pipeline(
    "image-text-to-text",
    model="google/medgemma-4b-it",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device="cuda",
)

# Image attribution: Stillwaterising, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons
image_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Chest_Xray_PA_3-8-2010.png"
image = Image.open(requests.get(image_url, headers={"User-Agent": "example"}, stream=True).raw)

messages = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "You are an expert radiologist."}]
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this X-ray"}
            {"type": "image", "image": image},
        ]
    }
]

output = pipe(text=messages, max_new_tokens=200)
print(output[0]["generated_text"][-1]["content"])
```

**Run the model directly**

```python
# pip install accelerate
from transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForImageTextToText
from PIL import Image
import requests
import torch

model_id = "google/medgemma-4b-it"

model = AutoModelForImageTextToText.from_pretrained(
    model_id,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto",
)
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)

# Image attribution: Stillwaterising, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons
image_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Chest_Xray_PA_3-8-2010.png"
image = Image.open(requests.get(image_url, headers={"User-Agent": "example"}, stream=True).raw)

messages = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "You are an expert radiologist."}]
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this X-ray"},
            {"type": "image", "image": image}
        ]
    }
]

inputs = processor.apply_chat_template(
    messages, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=True,
    return_dict=True, return_tensors="pt"
).to(model.device, dtype=torch.bfloat16)

input_len = inputs["input_ids"].shape[-1]

with torch.inference_mode():
    generation = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=200, do_sample=False)
    generation = generation[0][input_len:]

decoded = processor.decode(generation, skip_special_tokens=True)
print(decoded)
```

### Performance and validation

MedGemma was evaluated across a range of different multimodal classification,
report generation, visual question answering, and text-based tasks.

### Key performance metrics

#### Imaging evaluations

The multimodal performance of MedGemma 4B was evaluated across a range of
benchmarks, focusing on radiology, dermatology, histopathology, ophthalmology,
and multimodal clinical reasoning.

MedGemma 4B outperforms the base Gemma 3 4B model across all tested multimodal
health benchmarks.

| Task and metric | MedGemma 4B | Gemma 3 4B |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Medical image classification** |  |  |
| MIMIC CXR \- Average F1 for top 5 conditions | 88.9 | 81.1 |
| CheXpert CXR \- Average F1 for top 5 conditions | 48.1 | 31.2 |
| DermMCQA\* \- Accuracy | 71.8 | 42.6 |
| **Visual question answering** |  |  |
| SlakeVQA (radiology) \- Tokenized F1 | 62.3 | 38.6 |
| VQA-Rad\*\* (radiology) \- Tokenized F1 | 49.9 | 38.6 |
| PathMCQA (histopathology, internal\*\*\*)  \- Accuracy | 69.8 | 37.1 |
| **Knowledge and reasoning** |  |  |
| MedXpertQA (text \+ multimodal questions) \- Accuracy | 18.8 | 16.4 |

*Described in [Liu (2020, Nature
medicine)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0842-3), presented as a
4-way MCQ per example for skin condition classification.

**Based on "balanced split," described in [Yang (2024,
arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.03162).

***Based on multiple datasets, presented as 3-9 way MCQ per example for
identification, grading, and subtype for breast, cervical, and prostate cancer.

#### Chest X-ray report generation

MedGemma chest X-ray (CXR) report generation performance was evaluated on
[MIMIC-CXR](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/2.1.0/) using the [RadGraph
F1 metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14463). We compare the MedGemma
pre-trained checkpoint with our previous best model for CXR report generation,
[PaliGemma 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03555).

| Metric | MedGemma 4B (pre-trained) | PaliGemma 2 3B (tuned for CXR) | PaliGemma 2 10B (tuned for CXR) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Chest X-ray report generation** |  |  |  |
| MIMIC CXR \- RadGraph F1 | 29.5 | 28.8 | 29.5 |

The instruction-tuned versions of MedGemma 4B and Gemma 3 4B achieve lower
scores (0.22 and 0.12, respectively) due to the differences in reporting style
compared to the MIMIC ground truth reports. Further fine-tuning on MIMIC reports
will enable users to achieve improved performance.

#### Text evaluations

MedGemma 4B and text-only MedGemma 27B were evaluated across a range of
text-only benchmarks for medical knowledge and reasoning.

The MedGemma models outperform their respective base Gemma models across all
tested text-only health benchmarks.

| Metric | MedGemma 27B | Gemma 3 27B | MedGemma 4B | Gemma 3 4B |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| MedQA (4-op) | 89.8 (best-of-5) 87.7 (0-shot) | 74.9 | 64.4 | 50.7 |
| MedMCQA | 74.2 | 62.6 | 55.7 | 45.4 |
| PubMedQA | 76.8 | 73.4 | 73.4 | 68.4 |
| MMLU Med (text only) | 87.0 | 83.3 | 70.0 | 67.2 |
| MedXpertQA (text only) | 26.7 | 15.7 | 14.2 | 11.6 |
| AfriMed-QA | 84.0 | 72.0 | 52.0 | 48.0 |

For all MedGemma 27B results, [test-time
scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19393) is used to improve performance.

### Ethics and safety evaluation

#### Evaluation approach

Our evaluation methods include structured evaluations and internal red-teaming
testing of relevant content policies. Red-teaming was conducted by a number of
different teams, each with different goals and human evaluation metrics. These
models were evaluated against a number of different categories relevant to
ethics and safety, including:

*   **Child safety**: Evaluation of text-to-text and image-to-text prompts
    covering child safety policies, including child sexual abuse and
    exploitation.
*   **Content safety:** Evaluation of text-to-text and image-to-text prompts
    covering safety policies, including harassment, violence and gore, and hate
    speech.
*   **Representational harms**: Evaluation of text-to-text and image-to-text
    prompts covering safety policies, including bias, stereotyping, and harmful
    associations or inaccuracies.
*   **General medical harms:** Evaluation of text-to-text and image-to-text
    prompts covering safety policies, including information quality and harmful
    associations or inaccuracies.

In addition to development level evaluations, we conduct "assurance evaluations"
which are our "arms-length" internal evaluations for responsibility governance
decision making. They are conducted separately from the model development team,
to inform decision making about release. High-level findings are fed back to the
model team, but prompt sets are held out to prevent overfitting and preserve the
results' ability to inform decision making. Notable assurance evaluation results
are reported to our Responsibility & Safety Council as part of release review.

#### Evaluation results

For all areas of safety testing, we saw safe levels of performance across the
categories of child safety, content safety, and representational harms. All
testing was conducted without safety filters to evaluate the model capabilities
and behaviors. For text-to-text, image-to-text, and audio-to-text, and across
both MedGemma model sizes, the model produced minimal policy violations. A
limitation of our evaluations was that they included primarily English language
prompts.

### De-identification/anonymization:

Google and partnerships utilize datasets that have been rigorously anonymized or
de-identified to ensure the protection of individual research participants and
patient privacy

## Implementation information

Details about the model internals.

### Software

Training was done using [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax).

JAX allows researchers to take advantage of the latest generation of hardware,
including TPUs, for faster and more efficient training of large models.

## Use and limitations

### Intended use

MedGemma is an open multimodal generative AI model intended to be used as a
starting point that enables more efficient development of downstream healthcare
applications involving medical text and images. MedGemma is intended for
developers in the life sciences and healthcare space. Developers are responsible
for training, adapting and making meaningful changes to MedGemma to accomplish
their specific intended use. MedGemma models can be fine-tuned by developers
using their own proprietary data for their specific tasks or solutions.

MedGemma is based on Gemma 3 and has been further trained on medical images and
text. MedGemma enables further development in any medical context (image and
textual), however the model was pre-trained using chest X-ray, pathology,
dermatology, and fundus images. Examples of tasks within MedGemma's training
include visual question answering pertaining to medical images, such as
radiographs, or providing answers to textual medical questions. Full details of
all the tasks MedGemma has been evaluated can be found in an upcoming technical
report.

### Benefits

*   Provides strong baseline medical image and text comprehension for models of
    its size.
*   This strong performance makes it efficient to adapt for downstream
    healthcare-based use cases, compared to models of similar size without
    medical data pre-training.
*   This adaptation may involve prompt engineering, grounding, agentic
    orchestration or fine-tuning depending on the use case, baseline validation
    requirements, and desired performance characteristics.

### Limitations

MedGemma is not intended to be used without appropriate validation, adaptation
and/or making meaningful modification by developers for their specific use case.
The outputs generated by MedGemma are not intended to directly inform clinical
diagnosis, patient management decisions, treatment recommendations, or any other
direct clinical practice applications. Performance benchmarks highlight baseline
capabilities on relevant benchmarks, but even for image and text domains that
constitute a substantial portion of training data, inaccurate model output is
possible. All outputs from MedGemma should be considered preliminary and require
independent verification, clinical correlation, and further investigation
through established research and development methodologies.

MedGemma's multimodal capabilities have been primarily evaluated on single-image
tasks. MedGemma has not been evaluated in use cases that involve comprehension
of multiple images.

MedGemma has not been evaluated or optimized for multi-turn applications.

MedGemma's training may make it more sensitive to the specific prompt used than
Gemma 3.

When adapting MedGemma developer should consider the following:

*   **Bias in validation data:** As with any research, developers should ensure
    that any downstream application is validated to understand performance using
    data that is appropriately representative of the intended use setting for
    the specific application (e.g., age, sex, gender, condition, imaging device,
    etc).
*   **Data contamination concerns**: When evaluating the generalization
    capabilities of a large model like MedGemma in a medical context, there is a
    risk of data contamination, where the model might have inadvertently seen
    related medical information during its pre-training, potentially
    overestimating its true ability to generalize to novel medical concepts.
    Developers should validate MedGemma on datasets not publicly available or
    otherwise made available to non-institutional researchers to mitigate this
    risk.
